Title: Detecting Shared Mutations Associated with a Trait in a Phylogenetic Framework
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Amélie Ngo
Maintainer: Amélie Ngo
Description: Implements MutaPhy, a phylogeny-based method for detecting shared mutations
    associated with a trait by identifying phenotype-enriched clades in a phylogenetic
    tree. The method relies on permutation-based statistical tests and ancestral sequence
    reconstruction, and was developed and evaluated using simulated data as well as
    applied to dengue virus genomic and clinical datasets.
